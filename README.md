# shapeup
 
 This project contains the starter files for the in-class coding project that we will be working on together over the next few weeks. 

Create a "fork" of the shapeup starter files project:

- "Fork" this project to your Github
- Click the green "Code" button and select "Open with Github Desktop"
- A dialog box will appear - Click the "Clone" button to download a clone of the starter code to your laptop
- Github Desktop will ask if you want to "Contribute to the parent project" or if you want this clone "for my own purposes" - Select "for my own purposes"
- You now have your own copy of the Shape Up starter files stored locally on your laptop
- Select "Open in Visual Studio Code"
